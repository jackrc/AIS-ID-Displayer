# AIS ID Displayer

Userscript to aid in development for AIS. Adds a "display IDs" button to the top of the page which causes the AIS IDs for some 
elements to be displayed directly on the page (instead of needing to go through a menu). Example below for P0911

## Usage

Requires an extension such as [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-gb/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (Firefox) or 
[Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) (Chrome). You may need 
to modify the `@include` lines at the top in order to get this script to work with your JDE instance.
